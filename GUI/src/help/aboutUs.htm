			The developers of KodeLlama are a group of Rodman Scholars at the University of Virginia.
			We are all programmers to some extent and started off just like you, with a computer and
			no idea how to program. We thought that we could provide a tool for teaching kids like
			you how to program, a skill that is becoming more and more valuable in today's computer-run
			world. The target audience of KodeLlama is kids age 7-13, but anybody is welcome to give it a shot!<br />
			<br />
			We hope you enjoy your time using KodeLlama and learn to love programming like we do!
